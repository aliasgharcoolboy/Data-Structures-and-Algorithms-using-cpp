This code demonstrates how to delete an element from the beginning of an array in C++. It starts by taking the size of the array as input from the user and then allows the user to fill the array with elements. The program then displays the original array, deletes the first element, and finally displays the modified array.

In the `main` function, the program first asks the user to input the size of the array and stores it in the variable `n`. Then, it declares an array of size `n`. The user is prompted to enter `n` elements, which are stored in the array.

The function `DisplayArray` is used to print the contents of the array. It takes the array and its size as parameters and prints each element separated by a space.

The function `DeletionFromBeginning` is responsible for removing the first element of the array. It does this by shifting all elements one position to the left, effectively overwriting the first element. The loop runs from index `0` to `n-1`, assigning `array[i+1]` to `array[i]`. This means the second element moves to the first position, the third element moves to the second position, and so on. After shifting all elements, the value of `n` is decremented to reflect the new size of the array.

After the deletion, the modified array is displayed again using the `DisplayArray` function.

One issue in the code is the use of variable-length arrays (VLA), which are not standard in C++. Instead of `int numbers[n]`, dynamic memory allocation using `new` should be used, or a fixed-size array should be declared.

Additionally, when shifting elements, the last element is accessed using `array[i+1]`, which might cause an out-of-bounds access if not handled properly. However, since `n` is decreased after shifting, this does not cause an issue in this specific case.

In summary, this program initializes an array, takes user input, displays the original array, deletes the first element by shifting, and displays the updated array.
