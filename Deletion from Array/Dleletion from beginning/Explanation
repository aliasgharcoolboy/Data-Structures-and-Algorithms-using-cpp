This code is intended to demonstrate deletion of the first element from an array, but it contains a logical error in the input section. The program takes the size of the array from the user and then allows the user to input elements. However, it mistakenly only takes `n-1` elements instead of `n`, which means one element is missing from the array.

In the `main` function, the user is first asked to input the size of the array, which is stored in the variable `n`. Then, an array of size `n` is declared. However, when taking input for the elements, the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (`i < n-1`), which means only `n-1` elements are stored instead of `n`.

The function `DisplayArray` is used to print the elements of the array. It takes the array and its size as parameters and prints each element with spaces in between.

The function `DeletionFromBeginning` is supposed to remove the first element by shifting all elements one position to the left. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, which means the last iteration tries to access `array[n]`, which is out of bounds. After shifting, the size `n` is decremented to reflect the new size.

When the program executes, it first displays the original array, then deletes the first element, and finally displays the modified array.

However, due to the incorrect input loop (`for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)`), the last element of the array remains uninitialized, which may result in undefined behavior when displayed or manipulated. Additionally, in `DeletionFromBeginning`, the loop should run up to `n-1` instead of `n` to avoid accessing `array[n]`.

To fix the issues:
1. Change the input loop condition from `i < n-1` to `i < n` to take all elements properly.
2. Change the loop condition in `DeletionFromBeginning` from `i < n` to `i < n-1` to prevent accessing out-of-bounds memory.

With these corrections, the program will function correctly, allowing proper deletion of the first element and displaying the correct results.
