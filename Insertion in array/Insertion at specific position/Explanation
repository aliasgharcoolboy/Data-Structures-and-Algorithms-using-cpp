The program demonstrates how to insert an element at a specific position in an array in C++. It follows a simple approach where the user provides input for the array size, elements, and the position at which they want to insert a new element.

The program begins by including the necessary header file <iostream> and using the standard namespace. The function InsertionAtSpecificPosition takes an array and its size as parameters. It first prompts the user to input the element to be inserted and stores it in the variable Element_To_Insert. Then, it asks for the position at which the element should be inserted and stores it in pos.

To make space for the new element, a loop shifts all elements from the specified position onward one step to the right. The loop runs from the last element of the array (at index size) down to pos + 1, moving each element one index forward. After shifting the elements, the function assigns Element_To_Insert to array[pos], effectively inserting it at the specified position. Finally, the size of the array is incremented by one to reflect the change.

In the main function, the program starts by taking input for the initial size of the array. It initializes an array of fixed size 50 and fills it with user-provided elements. The function InsertionAtSpecificPosition is then called to perform the insertion. After the insertion, the updated array is displayed using a loop that prints each element.

This implementation assumes that the position provided by the user is valid (within the bounds of the array). However, if an invalid position (such as a negative index or one beyond the current size) is entered, it may cause unexpected behavior since the program does not include error handling for out-of-range positions.

The function `InsertionAtSpecificPosition` is responsible for inserting an element at a user-specified position in an array. It takes two parameters:  

1. `array[]` – The integer array where the element will be inserted.  
2. `size` – A reference variable that keeps track of the number of elements in the array.  

### Step-by-step working of the function:

1. The function first prompts the user to input an element to insert.  
2. It stores the user-provided element in `Element_To_Insert`.  
3. The function then asks for the position at which the element should be inserted and stores it in `pos`.  
4. A `for` loop shifts all elements starting from the last position (`size`) down to `pos + 1`, moving each element one index forward. This creates space at `pos` for the new element.  
5. After shifting the elements, `Element_To_Insert` is placed at `array[pos]`.  
6. The function increments `size` by 1 to reflect the addition of the new element.  

Example Execution:

Suppose the initial array is:  
`numbers = {2, 5, 8, 10}` with `size = 4`  

If the user wants to insert `7` at position `2`, the function performs the following steps:  

1. Shifts elements to the right:  
   ```
   numbers[4] = numbers[3] → {2, 5, 8, 10, 10}
   numbers[3] = numbers[2] → {2, 5, 8, 8, 10}
   ```
2. Inserts `7` at `numbers[2]`:  
   ```
   numbers = {2, 5, 7, 8, 10}
   ```
3. Increments `size` to `5`.

This logic ensures that elements are properly shifted to make room for the new element. However, if the user provides an invalid position (e.g., negative or greater than `size`), the program may behave unexpectedly because it does not check for out-of-bounds conditions.
